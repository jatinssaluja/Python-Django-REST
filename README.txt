Aforementioned Django models, Django Forms, and  Django Class-Based and Function-Based views are implemented for a single entity-controlled blog-site where the single entity, which can also be called a super-user, will have the option to draft, publish, list, update, and delete blogs. 

These blogs can be viewed by the internet users and commented upon. The internet users do not have to create an account in order to leave comments on the blogs. These comments can then be approved or removed by the super-user.

This project also draws upon Django REST Framework.
